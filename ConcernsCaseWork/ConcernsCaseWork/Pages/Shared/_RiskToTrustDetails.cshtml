        If a trust has multiple issues constituting concerns, the overall risk to trust rating should align with the highest level of concern if appropriate (for example, Amber/Red) in the Risk Management Framework (RMF). In certain circumstances, numerous concerns at a lower level may constitute a higher risk to trust rating. For example, multiple Amber/Green RMF concerns could constitute an overall higher level of risk (likely Amber/Red) to the trust, should the spread of issues cause greater concern.
